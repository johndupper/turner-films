# Turner Films

Welcome to my little slice of the internet.
This right here is a fun little application I've created 
to demonstrate I can whip up full-stack web application.

I've opted to use React, can you feel the MERN?

I apologize in advance for it's lack of utter beauty...
I've spent most my days server-side and wound up a little rusty on my CSS game. 

## Installation

`git clone https://github.com/johndupper/turner-films.git`

`cd turner-films`

`npm install`

Disclaimer: I've been told the database URL is top-secret.
If you happen to have the right one, please:

`touch .env` and define the url as follows:

`MONGO_DB_URL=` (...you know what goes here)

`npm start` and enjoy!

Ciao for now,
John Dupper
